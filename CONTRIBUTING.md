# Contribution Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of contributing your code assignments to the CodeChef-assignments repository using Git in the terminal.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository. Then, use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your CodeChef-VITC-Club-Assignments repository.

## Step 2: Create a Folder

Navigate into the local repository directory:

```bash
cd CodeChef-VITC-Club-Assignments
```

Create a folder with your name:

```bash
mkdir YourFirstName-YourLastName
```

## Step 3: Add Code Files to Your Folder

Navigate into your folder:

```bash
cd YourFirstName-YourLastName
```

Now, add your code files to this folder.

OR

If you want to make changes to your code then open these files in some code editor such as VSCode, Atom etc. 

## Step 4: Commit Your Changes

Go back to the root of the repository:

```bash
cd ..
```

Add your changes to the staging area and commit them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added code files for YourFirstName-YourLastName"
```

## Step 5: Push Your Changes

Push your changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push
```

## Step 6: Create an Issue

Visit the GitHub repository page and create an issue with the details of your assignment submission. You can use the GitHub website to do this.

## Step 7: Assignment Review and Completion

Once your issue is created, the club heads and mentors can review your code by commenting on the issue. Make necessary revisions if required. Once your assignment is reviewed and considered complete, it will be merged into the main repository by the club administrators.

By following these steps, you can contribute to the repository using Git in the terminal.

Happy coding!
